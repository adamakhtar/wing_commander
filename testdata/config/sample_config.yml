# Wing Commander Configuration Example
# This file shows how to configure Wing Commander for different test frameworks
#
# CLI-First Design: CLI options override config file settings
# Priority: CLI options > Config file > Sensible defaults

# Project path (can be overridden with --project-path CLI option)
# Default: current working directory
project_path: ""

# Test framework (currently only minitest reporters are supported)
test_framework: minitest

# Command to run tests (WingCommanderReporter must be registered in test_helper.rb)
# Use {{.Paths}} placeholder for test paths (empty by default)
test_command: "bundle exec rake test {{.Paths}}"

# Path to the summary file produced by WingCommanderReporter
test_results_path: ".wing_commander/test_results/summary.yml"

# Patterns to exclude from backtrace analysis
exclude_patterns:
  - "/gems/"
  - "/lib/ruby/"
  - "/vendor/bundle/"

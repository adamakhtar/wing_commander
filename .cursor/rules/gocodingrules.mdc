### **Rules for Writing Good Go Code for CLI Tools**

#### 1. **Readability and Clarity**

- Code must be easy to read and understand by other developers.
- Use descriptive variable, function, and package names. Avoid abbreviations unless widely recognized (`ctx` for `context` is acceptable).
- Keep functions small and focused; ideally, each function does one thing only.

#### 2. **Project Structure**

- Follow idiomatic Go project structure:

  ```
  /cmd        # main CLI entry points
  /internal   # internal packages not exposed publicly
  /pkg        # reusable packages
  /configs    # configuration files
  /docs       # documentation
  /test       # tests
  ```

- Keep `main.go` minimal; delegate logic to packages.

#### 3. **Error Handling**

- Always check and handle errors explicitly.
- Use `fmt.Errorf` or `errors.Wrap` (if using `pkg/errors`) to add context to errors.
- Avoid panic unless it’s unrecoverable and clearly documented.

#### 4. **CLI Best Practices**

- Use a standard CLI library like `cobra` or `urfave/cli`.
- Provide clear help messages and usage instructions.
- Support common CLI flags (`--help`, `--version`).
- Follow consistent flag naming conventions (e.g., `--config` instead of `-c` unless shorthand is common).

#### 5. **Logging and Output**

- Use `log` or structured logging libraries like `zap` or `logrus`.
- Keep CLI output user-friendly; use plain messages for standard output and structured logs for debugging.
- Do not mix standard output and logging messages.

#### 6. **Testing**

- Write unit tests for all non-trivial functions.
- Use table-driven tests for readability and maintainability.
- Test CLI commands using integration tests (e.g., invoking the binary in a controlled environment).

#### 7. **Code Style and Formatting**

- Follow `gofmt` strictly. No custom indentation rules.
- Keep lines under 100–120 characters for readability.
- Use Go naming conventions:

  - `CamelCase` for exported functions/types.
  - `camelCase` for private functions/variables.

- Avoid global variables unless absolutely necessary.

#### 8. **Dependencies**

- Minimize external dependencies. Only use well-maintained, stable libraries.
- Use Go modules (`go.mod`) and pin versions to avoid breaking changes.

#### 9. **Performance and Efficiency**

- Avoid premature optimization; focus on readability first.
- Use efficient data structures (`map`, `slice`) appropriately.
- For CLI tools, ensure operations are non-blocking when possible and provide progress feedback for long-running tasks.

#### 10. **Documentation**

- Add comments for all exported functions, types, and packages.
- Keep README clear with installation, usage, and example commands.
- Document assumptions, limitations, and error cases for each command.

#### 11. **Security and Safety**

- Sanitize inputs from the user.
- Avoid unsafe operations unless necessary.
- Validate file paths, environment variables, and network inputs carefully.

#### 12. **Version Control Best Practices**

- Follow semantic versioning (`v1.0.0`).
- Keep commits small, clear, and descriptive.
- Include CHANGELOG for public releases.
